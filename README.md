# demo-graphic

A fairly simple 3D graphics program that use OpenGL shaders.

To build on a Mac or on Linux:

$ git clone http://github.com:tsgouros/demo-graphic.git
$ cd demo-graphic
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ bin/demo

If you're using XCode or Windows, this will probably work, too, but
someone else has to make the instructions.
